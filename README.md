Machine-learning Wine quality prediction
================


The purpose of this experiment is to find most
suitable classifer to predict wine type and qual-
ity given a classic dataset on Portugese ’Vinho
Verde’ wines which has 11 different chemical
properties. The wine type includes white and
red and the wine quality is classified by wine
experts between 1 (good) and 7 (bad).
The given dataset is divided into 5000 train-
ing samples and 1000 test samples and stored
in two .csv files.
Each of them has 13
columns including 11 chemical measures and
two columns depicting wine type and quality.
Thus we can use training samples to fit mod-
els and validate those models and report their
prediction perfomances with the test samples.
